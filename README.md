# How To Play
1. A grid will be displayed labled 1-9, each number represents the position to place a symbol of "X" or "O"
2. Enter the number you wish to move and your symbol will be placed in that position and it will be the next players turn
3. First player that gets 3 symbols in a row in any direction wins the game
4. The game will automatically keep a tally, press 1 to replay another or 0 to end the game.
